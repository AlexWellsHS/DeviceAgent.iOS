### Objective-C

1. Use spaces, not tabs.
2. Indents should be 4 spaces.
3. As much as possible, limit each line to no more than 80 characters.
4. Use Unicode UTF-8 and Unix newlines.

When in doubt, refer to this guide:

If you are making a change to file, limit the number of style changes to as close to zero as possible so the diff can be easily read.

One strategy is to make your changes, submit the PR, have it accepted, then make a style commit onto develop.
